# Tiny-Improvements

## Tiny-Improvements

- is an app that helps communicate "kudos" or compliments from one individual to another,

- allows an individual to register for an account,

- allows an individual to login to their account and send a kudo after they select the receiver.

## Purpose
- Too often, good deeds and accomplishments go unnoticed. Sometimes, people who wish to give compliments may find it too *awkward* to approach one another with a compliment. **Tiny-Improvements aims to alleviate the dearth of positive communication.**

- **Tiny-Improvements** practices the use of MongoDB and Mongoose ODM

## How it Works
1. Register User takes in the Username and Password paramters to create a unique login.

2. After a user is created, it is assigned a specific "token id" that is used to sign any messages that is "sent" and "received."

3. The individual, after having created a login, can login and "Give a Kudos" to other registered users.

4. The kudos then are displayed on the front page for anyone to see, registered users or not.

## Future Feature(s)
- Each individual user will have a profile picture.

- Stronger encryption for registering and logging in.
